experimental trading bots - for Binance

This project have some experimental bots I created.
This are all runing with Python. 
Libraries requeried: ccxt, pandas, time (most cases).

The idea is to create a bot for trading with variations in seconds, or few minutes. 
It have to be clear to predict when the price could increase or decrease.

There are different techniques: RSI, MA, AI.
